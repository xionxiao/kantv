          accesses are limited to local memory.

  Returns a value that indicates whether the QuRT system executes in Island mode.

/**@ingroup func_qurt_island_get_status2
  Gets Island mode status especially that differentiates between island partial exit and complete exit.
 
  Returns a value that indicates the current state. 
  
  @note1hang Transition from NORMAL mode to ISLAND mode happens in single
             threaded mode. Whereas transition from ISLAND mode to other modes
             happen in multi-threaded mode. So, a thread that gets island mode
             status as NORMAL can assume the same status till it continues to
             run. A thread that gets island mode status as ISLAND should 
             assume that the status may change to EXITING or NORMAL while it
             runs. A thread that gets island mode status as EXITING should
             assume that the status may change to NORMAL while it runs. If 
             the thread goes to wait state in after reading the status, it should get
             the island mode state again and not assume the previous state. 
  @note2hang This api returns more intrinsic states than qurt_island_get_status,
             when qurt_island_get_status returns 0, this api could return 
             QURT_ISLAND_MODE_EXITING or QURT_ISLAND_MODE_ISLAND
