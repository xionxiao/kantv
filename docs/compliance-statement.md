1.This project used for learning and studying device-AI tech on Android phone equipped with Qualcomm high-end mobile SoC.

  The Android apk which built from the source codes of this project follows the principles of 'minimum permissions' and 'do not collect unnecessary user data'.Actually, the Android apk will <b>not collect any user data of upload any user data to server/cloud</b>.

2.This project is a <b>pure AI learning&study</b> project, so the Android APK is a <b>green</b> Android APP and will <b>NOT</b> collect/upload user data in Android device, following minimum permissions are required:
  - Access to storage is required for TV recording(write recording data to storage) and ASR/LLM inference(read/load models from storage)
  - Access to device information is required to obtain phone's network status information, distinguishing whether the current network is Wi-Fi or mobile when playing online TV

3.This project focus on device-AI tech and source code of libkantv-media.so will not be open-sourced currently because it contains proprietary IPR.
