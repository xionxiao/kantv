# KanTV

KanTV("Kan", aka Chinese PinYin "Kan" or Chinese HanZi "çœ‹" or English "watch/listen") , an open source project focus on study and practise state-of-the-art AI technology in <b>real scenario</b>(such as online-TV playback and online-TV transcription(real-time subtitle) and online-TV language translation and online-TV video&audio recording works at the same time) on **Android phone/device**, derived from original ![ijkplayer](https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/tree/kantv-initial)(because that project has stopped maintenance since 2021) , with much enhancements and new features:

- Watch online TV and local media by my customized ![FFmpeg 6.1](https://github.com/zhouwg/FFmpeg), source code of my customized FFmpeg 6.1 could be found in <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/tree/master/external/ffmpeg-6.1"> external/ffmpeg </a>according to <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/legal.html">FFmpeg's license</a>

- Record online TV to automatically generate videos (useful for short video creators to generate short video materials but pls respect IPR of original content creator/provider); record online TV's video / audio content for gather video / audio data which might be required of/useful for AI R&D activity

- AI subtitle(real-time English subtitle for English online-TV(aka OTT TV) by the great & excellent & amazing<a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp"> whisper.cpp </a>), pls attention Xiaomi 14 / Xiaomi 15 or other powerful Android mobile phone is HIGHLY required/recommended for AI subtitle feature otherwise unexpected behavior would happen

- 2D graphic performance

- Set up a customized playlist and then use this software to watch the content of the customized playlist for R&D activity

- UI refactor(closer to real commercial Android application and only English is supported in UI language currently)

- Well-maintained "workbench" for ASR(Automatic Speech Recognition) researchers/developers/programmers who was interested in practise state-of-the-art AI tech(such as [whisper.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/whisper.cpp)) in <b>real scenario on Android phone/device</b>(<a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/kantv/issues/64">PoC: realtime AI subtitle for online-TV(aka OTT TV) on Xiaomi 14 finished from 03/05/2024 to 03/16/2024</a>)


- Well-maintained "workbench" for LLM(Large Language Model) researchers/developers who was interested in practise state-of-the-art AI tech(such as [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp)) in real scenario on Android phone/device, or Run/experience LLM model(such as llama-2-7b, baichuan2-7b, qwen1_5-1_8b, gemma-2b, DeepSeek) on Android phone/device using the magic llama.cpp

- Well-maintained "workbench" for <a href="https://github.com/ggerganov/ggml">GGML</a> beginners to study internal mechanism of GGML inference framework on Android phone/device

- Well-maintained <b>turn-key / self-contained</b> project for AI researchers(whom mightbe not familiar with <b>regular Android software development</b>)/developers/beginners focus on edge/device-side AI learning / R&D activity, some AI R&D activities (AI algorithm validation / AI model validation / performance benchmark in ASR, LLM, TTS, NLP, CV......field) could be done by Android Studio IDE + a powerful Android phone very easily

### Highlight

As far as I know, probably be the first <a href="https://github.com/zhouwg/ggml-hexagon/discussions/18"> open-source ggml-hexagon backend for llama.cpp on Qualcomm's Hexagon NPU equipped phone</a>


### Software architecture of KanTV Android

### Building the project

- Clone this repository and build locally, see [how to build](./docs/build.md)
- Download pre-built Android APK from https://github.com/kantv-ai/kantv/releases(TBD)

### Run Android APK on Android phone

You will need an Android smartphone with adb-connected running on one of below Qualcomm SoCs:

    Snapdragon 8 Gen 1
    Snapdragon 8 Gen 1+
    Snapdragon 8 Gen 2
    Snapdragon 8 Gen 3
    Snapdragon 8 Elite


This project is a <b>pure AI learning&study</b> project, so the Android APK is a green Android APP and will not collect/upload user data in Android device. The Android APK should be works well on any Qualcomm mobile SoC equipped <b>mainstream</b> Android phone and the following permissions are required:

- Access to storage is required for ASR inference and LLM inference(read/load models from storage)
- Access to device information is required to obtain phone's network status information, distinguishing whether the current network is Wi-Fi or mobile when playing online TV
